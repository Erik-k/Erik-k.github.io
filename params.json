This lets me form a secure, encrypted tunnel from wherever I'm roaming (such as public wifi hotspots) back to my house. All my data traffic is routed through this secure connection, so if I'm browsing the web or logging in to things on my phone, it cannot be eavesdropped on from the point of the public wifi router.

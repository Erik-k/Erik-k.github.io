K'NEK-TEK Webpage
=================

Trying to get knek-tek.com, knek-tek.me, and knek-tek.net to point to the page generated by GitHub.

If I use WordPress to create the knek-tek.me site, it'll look nice but will be complex. I should create a branch of the code and perhaps use Jekyll to create a simple, static, HTML-only version of the website which can then be used for the tor location-hidden service version.
